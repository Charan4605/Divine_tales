Divine_Tales
Divine_Tales is a project developed by
Charan (23BCS047),
Sai Sathwik (23BCS036),
Sai Rithvik (23BCS070), and
Dinesh (23BCS027) — students of the LLM course at IIIT Dharwad, under the guidance of Dr. Sunil Saumya Sir.

This chatbot-based application is designed to generate personalized bedtime stories. While it primarily focuses on creating engaging and magical tales for children, it is also capable of generating more intricate narratives for older audiences.

With Divine_Tales, storytelling becomes a fun, interactive, and imaginative experience — making bedtime truly special.
